#Iron Workers Union
##My first 3 weeks as a student at _The Iron Yard_

###Week 1

I thought I was ready. I really did. The amount that I was not prepared was staggering. My brain (rusty from years of bopring repetitive admin work) throbbed almost nightly. The years of working in Silicon Valley in the 90s that I thought would be helpful turned out to hold me back. Having to let go of old ways of doing things and accept this new method and absorb all this knowledge is a task that I never fully saw the scope of. 

I'm in it 100% though and I will come out the other side better for it.

###Week 2

Things are clicking better now. I am enjoying creating from mockups, which was always my forte anyway. All these divs and parent and child elements seems messy but I know that everything comes with time and the code will get better. 

I suffered a minor set back in class this week. After working on the homework for the weekend preceding, I didn't take many breaks and gave myself a DVT. I'm thinking that I will have to use this as my inspiration for my final project somehow. I can't be the only one this has happened to and finding a way to spread the word/keep even one more person from going through what I went through seems like something I should task myself with doing.

###Week 3 

Still recovering from my hospital stay and trying to get things back on track code-wise. I'm still behind on the weekend assignment...stuck with a content div that won't move. Hoping Sam will help me fix on Wednesday so that I can put this assignment to rest and be caught up with the rest of the class. 

Grid layouts make sense to my head but coding the CSS and HTML for them doesn't seem to come easily. I'll tinker more with it tonight.
