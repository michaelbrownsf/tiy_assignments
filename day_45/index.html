			The Problem
		</h1>
		<p>Garcias was a relatively new restaurant in town. However, they had a very outdated website. It was all in red whites and greens reminiscent of the Mexican flag and was visually unappealing. It also didn't provide any information in the website itself that would inform the customer or have them come back to the website for any particular reason.
		</p>

		<p>After speaking with the manager for about an hour, I was able to determine that each location of Garcias restaurants was owned by a sibling of the Garcia family. This particular location was owned by one of the sons. Each location has their own website and we felt that designing this one for him in a masculine pallet and put information on the pages that would keep people returning to the website were two of the most important tasks. </p>

		<p>One thing that you would notice immediately upon browsing their current website is the fact that all of their menu items are in PDF files. For this particular project we decided to go for a limited menu to show how the website layout the menu. Details on this layout can be found in the Grid section.</p>

		<h2>The Solution</h2>
		<p>Design a new site that incorporates a more masculine tone and bring the menu into the site and out of the PDFs.

		<h2 id="grid">Grid</h2>
		<h1>
			The Problem
		</h1>
		<p>
			With a large menu it is important to keep the grid consitently spaced as you would with printed menu. Two column layout is sufficient to achieve the desired effect on tablets and larger. Cell phones will show one column.
		</p>
		<h1>The Solution</h1>
		<p>
			Use RWD and media queries to allow the site to be viewed on phones or tablets. Bring the menu into the site and provide a place for engaging content.
		</p>
<h2 id="colors">Colors</h2>
								
		<h1>Color Choices</h1>
			<p>Using the orange from their tortilla warmers as a base I chose a complementary shade of blue which provided the masculine feel the owner would like. Deciding to stay away from solid white backgrounds I chose a very soothing, creamy shade of yellow.<p>
		<p>
			Swatches here.

			Orange = ##f17c21
			Blue = ##222b30
			Cream = ##f3f7e0

		<h1> Font choices and text breakdown</h1>

		<p>
			Headings are used to denote different sections of content, usually consisting of related paragraphs and other HTML elements. They range from h1 to h4 and should be styled in a clear hierarchy (i.e., largest to smallest).

			Garcia's old site used a font they did not have license to use and it was embedded in a graphic. I chose two fonts from Adobe Font Kit the first called coquette was reminiscent of the script font they were using on their site but provided a much cleaner look. I also chose Proxima nova a san-serif font with a modern feel.
		</p>
		<h1>
			Coquette and Proxima Nova
		</h1>
		<p>
			Paragraphs are groups of sentences, each with a lead (first sentence) and transition (last sentence). They are block level elements, meaning they stack vertically when repeated. Garcias doesn't currently have much content that would require a paragraph formatting. For this project you're more concerned with the menu layout.

			Use H2 tags for the menu section title. Use H3 tags for the item title. Use P tags for the description and price.
		</p>

		<h2 id="buttons">
			Buttons
		</h2>

		<p>
			Besides links buttons are another method for your user to interact with your site. This means that buttons should be styled and not left to default values.

		<h1>
			Elements of a Form
		</h1>
		<p>
			If a user needs to submit information to the site it will be done using the elements below.
			A form should be marked up using it&#39;s default HTML properties.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>form</li>
			<li>label</li>
			<li>input</li>
			<li>select</li>
			<li>textarea</li>
			<li>button</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			How to Use
		</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Wrap checkboxes and radio buttons within labels for larger hit areas, and be sure to set the for, name, and id attributes for all applicable elements.</li>
			<li>Series of checkboxes and radio buttons below within a <code>&lt;ul class=&quot;(inline) actions&quot;&gt;</code>.</li>
			<li>Before selecting any set of fields to use for a required input, explore other options (e.g., radio buttons over select lists).</li>
		</ol>

		<h1>
			When to Use
		</h1>
		<p>
			Lists are great for presenting a series of related phrases or sentences that need to be read faster (skimming).
		</p>
		<h1>
			Which to Use
		</h1>
		<p>
			Our styles allow for a multitude of lists, including: ul for generic lists and ol for numbered lists.
