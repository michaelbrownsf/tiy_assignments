		<div class="review"><h3>Vicki A. -</h3><p>awesome little Resturant. Staff is always friendly and food is alway soooooo good!!! Not on the menu? Ask.. They will make it if they can. This place is a gem... Best kept secret!!!</div>
		<div class="review"><h3>Christina W. -</h3><p>My husband and I tried this place out for dinner.  The restaurant was clean and festive.
		We got complimentary salsa and chips which was good. The chips were warm and the salsa was mild which is more appealing to the masses.</div>

		<div class="review"><h3>Jim O. -</h3><p>I know I've mentioned the great rice & beans before but now I can tell you about there best entree.  Spinach Enchiladas.  They were to die for! 
		And I realize I've failed to mention the wait staff.</p> <p>Today we had Maureen who is awesome, but Ana is great also. My friend Ray says all the staff is great, but these two stand out!</div>
		<div class="review"><h3>K M. -</h3><p>Garcia's is by far my favorite Mexican place within a 20 mile radius (even though they have like 5 other locations within that radius).  I freaking LOVE their fajitas nortenas. Onions, tomatoes, and fresh jalapeno slices with dat chicken is amazing. Corn tortillas, salsa, charro beans, and guacamole - ALL GREAT. </div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="review"><h3>Joseph V. -</h3><p>Always pretty quick and service is good. Food isn't bad. I don't mind going because the prices are decent and they are quick at bringing it out!</div>
		<div class="review"><h3>Stacy S. -</h3><p>The service is good but if you go around dinner time there will be a wait.  Salsa is great but the tortilla soup is amazing!  Best soup around and super friendly staff. Place is a bit crowded... </div>
	</div>
		<div class="row">
		<div class="review"><h3>Amy G. -</h3><p>Not bad...I judge a restaurant by their enchiladas but these are just so-so. I'm not too big on the red sauce but I have had other dishes that are good.</div>
		<div class="review"><h3>Chris D. -</h3><p>This is one of our regular stops. The chips and salsa are second to none. The taco salad shrunk a bit in the last couple years, but is still tasty. My wife digs the Tortilla Soup. You can always count on the enchiladas too.</div>
