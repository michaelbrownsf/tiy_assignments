#My Story

I never knew I was at risk for a DVT. I was a relatively healthy 44 year old male, taking medicine for some hormonal issues. I was never told by anyone that this increased my chances of developing a clot in my veins.

Sadly, that's exactly what happened. A clot formed in my left leg. It was extremely painful and required hospitilization. 

Technology professionals are prone to these types of clots due to our somewhat sedentary lifestyles. Knowing your risk factors beforehand can help you avoid what I went through.

*	Inheriting a blood-clotting disorder. 

Some people inherit a disorder that makes their blood clot more easily. This inherited condition may not cause problems unless combined with one or more other risk factors.

*	A personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (PE). 

If you or someone in your family has had DVT or PE before, you're more likely to develop DVT.

*	Being overweight or obese. 

Being overweight increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs.

*	Birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy.

Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and hormone replacement therapy both can increase your blood's ability to clot.

These are just some that applied to me.

I'm now recovering from a clot that is about six inches long. The recovery can take as long as 6 months. 

During this time I am taking steps to make sure that I don't fall victim to another clot:

*	Working from a standing position for at least 15 minutes of an hour
*	Taking a anti-clotting medication 
*	Checking my INR (International Normalized Ratio, a measurement of how long it takes blood to clot) regulary
*	Watching my diet
