<h1>Diagnosis</h1>
<p>To determine whether you may have a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), your doctor will ask you questions about your current symptoms and obtain your medical history to better assess your risk factors. </p>

<p>A physical examination will be done to check for extremity swelling, tenderness and skin discoloration. If your symptoms, medical history and physical examination suggest that a blood clot is likely, testing will be done which may include:
</p>

<h2>Blood tests:</h2>

<p>A blood test can be used to rule out presence of a DVT. If the D-dimer test is negative and you are determined to have a low-risk for DVT (based upon the history and physical examination), further testing with an imaging study to rule out a blood clot may not be needed. However, if the suspicion that you have a blood clot is intermediate or high, an imaging study needs to be done.</p>

<h2>Imaging studies which diagnose DVT:</h2>

<p>A Doppler ultrasound (Duplex)</b> is a painless and noninvasive test used to diagnose DVT. During a Doppler ultrasound, sound waves are used to generate pictures of the blood vessels. In most cases, Doppler ultrasound is the preferred test to diagnose DVT.</p>

<p>A contrast venogram is often reserved for situations in which a Doppler ultrasound is not feasible. During contrast venogram, a catheter is inserted into
a vein and dye is injected, allowing your doctor to see the vein with an x-ray.</p>

<p>A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a strong magnet to createan image of inside the body. MRI is reserved for situations in which a contrast venogram cannot be performed.</p>

<p>Computer tomography (CT)venography or MRI venography are the preferred tests to look at blood clots in the pelvis or the abdomen.</p>
