# DVT PSA

## History & Intro
Three weeks into class I was in a terrible amount of pain in my left leg. I tried everything I could to get comfortable. I became aware that I was disturbing the class.

Sam Kapila turned to me and asked what was wrong. This was the first time I realized something might be amiss. She immediately sent me to see a doctor.

I'm glad she did. Turns out I had a 6 inch clot in one of my veins burried deep in my left leg. 


## Project Issues and Goals

This topic hit home for me. As coders and designers, we are prone to long bouts in our chairs staring at code. We can't ignore our bodies like so many of us do. 

The information on the web isn't cohesive or coherent. There are a number of factors that go into your risk to develop a clot in your leg. These can be painful and even fatal if not treated.

My goal is to provide a resource that will inform without scaring the user. Bringing resources from the web into one location.

## Audience

My audience, in particular, is people who are high risk for developing or have developed a Deep Vein Thrombosis.

## Competitive Market Study

Currently there are no direct competitors. No single site out there deals with this issue as its subject alone. WebMD has information on it as do many non-profit hospitals. 

## SWOT Analysis

###Strengths
*	I am personally affected by this malady
*	I have done a lot of research on this topic
*	I am able to tell a story that will inform and entertain

###Weaknesses
*	I am NOT a medical professional
*	I don't understand all the terms that are thrown around dealing with this topic

###Opportunities
*	I have the opportunity to share my story and spread the word about a topic near and dear to me

*	Provide a safe and non-threatening place for people to learn about this problem without being preachy or frightening

###Threats
*	There is a LOT of information on the internet that is poorly sourced or scattered from one site to the next. Bringing in the best information and restructuring it and editing it down will be a big project if I don't impliment a content strategy
